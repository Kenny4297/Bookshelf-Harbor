## Description
Bookshelf Harbor is a digital platform that allows users to purchase any book from the Open Library API using Stripe, a mock credit card library. Due to Open Library having over 4.4 million books in its database, I choose to not to include a Book model, and simply use API fetch requests for getting data on a particular book. 

## Motivation
I wanted practice with creating a full stack E-Commerce website, since I have not created one before!

## Technologies
React, Stripe, MongoDB, Mongoose, Open Library API

## Features
On the home page, users can either search for a book using the books title, author, category, or key words, or they can browse through the list of book categories. They can add their book selections to a shopping cart and end up purchasing the books! 

## Examples
IP

## Installation
They can visit the deployment link once it is deployed

## Troubleshooting
None so far!

## Contributing
Simply fork the repository and add anything you think might make the project better!
